<!-- 
  There are 3 parts to this exercise, focus on the first two parts, if you have time and want to show
      more of your abilities please feel free to do as much of the 3rd part as you are able to.

  !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Please just create a fork of this project to do your work on.!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

  Part 1: Render a list from API call
    - Data API -  https://emplistapi-258220.appspot.com/
    - API returns list employees with the following format:
            {
              "name": {
                        "first": string,
                        "last": string,
                      },
              "jobTitle": string,
              "photoURL": string?
            }
    - The API accepts two parameters: pageSize, pageNumber (theres a limited amount of mock data, high 
      page numbers wont contain data)
    - Employees are required to have a first name, last name, and job title.
    - Not all employees have a photo
    - Sample list view - https://storage.googleapis.com/sampleemplistbucket/interviewsample.jpg
        - Please use this as a reference for what could be done
  Part 2: Implement an "Add Employee" button
    - Clicking the button should show a modal form containing all possible fields used to add an employee
    - The data provided doesn't actually need to save to the server. Clicking
      "save", however, should show a message that the employee was saved, then close the      
      modal. 
    - The data that would have been saved to the server should be the return value of the function
    - There are a limited amount of job title options
    - Required employee information should be validated before saving
  Part 3: Optional things that you might want to do if you are able to and want to show you abilities
    - Sorting
    - Drag and drop
    - Load more
    - Anything else that you can think of that might be useful on a web form like this

  Requirements:
    - Only needs to work in Chrome. Other browsers will not be looked at.
    - Should be responsive from 375x667 (iPhone 6/7/8 preset in Chrome Dev Tools) to 1920x1080. 
      *** 768x1024 to 1920x1080 should be prioritized ***
    - Document any assumptions
    - Any style guide is fine, but MUST be consistent
    - Can use Bulma (included)
    - DO NOT use any other libraries or frameworks (jQuery, React, etc)
    - Does not need to be pixel perfect, focus is on reusability, readability, consistency, best practices, etc.
